    Returned by `AuditStore.unattributed`, which is what the startup
    lazy-adoption backfill (`nora.app.adoption`) re-resolves against a freshly
    loaded `identity.toml`. It carries `platform` — which `TranscriptRow`
    deliberately does not, being scoped to one conversation already — because
    person resolution is keyed `(platform, sender_id)`, so a row without its
    platform cannot be re-resolved at all.

    `body` is `str | None` for the same reason the column is nullable: an
    attachment-only message audits with no text. There is nothing to feed a
    peer from such a row, only a `person_id` to record.

    `raw_json` is the FULL stored envelope, and it is here for the operator
    control plane (`nora persons pending`), not for adoption — which ignores
    it. It has to be here rather than on a second port method because of what
    `sender_id` alone cannot answer: under Signal's sealed sender the same
    account arrives as a phone number on one message and as an ACI uuid on
    another (`nora.platform.signal.parser` reads `source or sourceNumber or
    sourceUuid`), so a column of `sender_id`s lists ONE account as TWO pending
    entries — and pasting those into two `[[persons.x.signal]]` blocks is
    precisely the copy-paste duplicate `nora.persons.load_persons` now refuses
    to start on. The envelope carries every id form that arrived together, so
    it is what lets them be correlated back into one account.

    The cost is one extra column on a scan `nora.app.adoption` runs at every
    start; it is bounded by that scan's own `limit` (1000 rows) and by an
    audit table already bounded by retention, and a Signal envelope is a
    couple of kilobytes. A second port method returning the same rows plus
    one column would have been the alternative, and it would oblige every
    future `AuditStore` to implement two near-identical scans.
