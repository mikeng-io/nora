"""`SqlNoteStore` — the note tier's store, over SQLAlchemy Core and the four
tables migration `0026_note_tier` lands
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-note-tier-design.md).

Still no writer above it: `nora.agent` has no `note_create`/`note_update`
tools yet and `nora.dreamer` has no note adaptor, so this class exists today to
be exercised by `tests/contract/test_note_store_contract.py`, and to be wired
into both later without changing shape.

**The three behaviours that are load-bearing rather than incidental**, and what
breaks if any of them is reversed:

1. **`create` is one transaction.** The `note` row's `head_revision_id` names
   the revision written beside it, and `read`/`search` both JOIN on that id. A
   note whose head was committed before (or without) its revision is a title in
   the injected index with no body behind it — reachable by the model, and
   unreadable. There is deliberately no FK from `note.head_revision_id` to
   `note_revision.id` (the two tables reference each other, so one direction has
   to give), which is exactly why the atomicity has to be enforced here.

2. **`append_revision` is a compare-and-swap, expressed as the `UPDATE`'s own
   `WHERE`** — never a read, a comparison in Python, and then a write. Between
   those two statements is the window the CAS exists to close: the curator
   merging the note mid-turn, or a parallel turn in the other room of the same
   workspace. `UPDATE note SET head_revision_id = :new WHERE id = :id AND
   workspace = :ws AND head_revision_id = :parent` is atomic in Postgres, so a
   `rowcount` of 0 IS the refusal, decided by the database rather than by a
   racing reader. On 0 the transaction rolls back and `StaleNoteHeadError` is
   raised: nothing is written on top, ever.

3. **Every read carries `WHERE workspace = :workspace`.** Unreachable, not
   merely unrendered. `read` on a note in another workspace returns `None`,
   exactly as if it did not exist — a caller must not be able to distinguish
   "no such note" from "not yours", because the distinction alone confirms the
   note exists. `append_revision` refuses across the boundary for the same
   reason, and reports `observed_head = None` rather than the real head.

**Search joins the head, and that join is the property §5.3 actually wanted.**
The design says the trigram index is "maintained on the head revision only". It
cannot be, as a partial index: which revision is the head is a fact about the
`note` row, not a predicate over `note_revision`, so there is nothing for
`postgresql_where` to test (migration 0026's own docstring records this
deviation). `idx_note_revision_body_trgm` therefore covers superseded bodies
too, and `search`'s `note.head_revision_id = note_revision.id` join is what
keeps them out of the result. A search that surfaced a superseded body would
return something true-in-the-past as though it were current — the same class of
error the partial `idx_fact_standing` avoids by never rendering a superseded
fact.

**`ilike`, not the trigram similarity operator `%`.** `gin_trgm_ops` carries
amops for both, so `idx_note_revision_body_trgm` serves either — but they answer
different questions. `%` is whole-string similarity against
`pg_trgm.similarity_threshold`: «did anyone mention a hotel?» against a
three-sentence body shares a handful of trigrams out of dozens, scores far below
0.3, and returns nothing — a `nothing_found` for a body that plainly says
`hotel` (measured: `body % 'venue2999'` matched 0 of 3000 rows that all contain
the string). Substring containment is the question `note_search` is actually
asked, so `ilike '%…%'` is the operator, with the caller's query escaped.

**What the index actually does, read off `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` on PostgreSQL 18.4,
3000 notes, 2026-08-21** — rather than assumed, since an index nobody measured is
a claim, not a plan:

- The GIN index IS reachable through a **parameterised** `ilike '%' || $1 ||
  '%'`, not only a literal pattern. SQLAlchemy emits exactly that, so this
  store's own query is the one that was measured, not a hand-written stand-in.
- For a query of **three or more characters** it narrows properly: the bitmap
  index scan returned 1 row of 3000 and touched 1 heap block.
- For a query of **two characters** — `酒店`, and this is the realistic Cantonese
  case — pg_trgm cannot extract a complete trigram, so the bitmap index scan
  returns *every* row (3000) and the recheck discards 2999. The answer is still
  correct; the index simply does no work. That is a knowable limitation of
  trigrams, and it is the price of the alternative being *wrong*: a
  `to_tsvector('english', …)` does not segment Chinese at all, so the same query
  returns nothing while reporting success (§5.3).
- At this tier's real size the planner **chooses a sequential scan anyway** — a
  few thousand short bodies is 62 pages, cheaper to read than any index. The
  index earns its keep later, and costs nothing now. So the property this store
  actually depends on for correctness is `ilike`'s substring semantics, which
  hold with or without the index; the index is a performance affordance, and
  nothing here reads a null result as evidence of absence because of it.

**Entity resolution is out of scope for this store**, matching `SqlFactStore`.
`anchor_entity_ids` is written verbatim to `note.anchor_entity_ids`, the column
`note_has_an_anchor_check` reads; the `note_entity` join table — whose
`entity_id` is FK'd to `fact_entity.id` — is NOT populated here, because writing
it would require every anchor entity to already be a resolved canonical entity,
and resolving `big walk` / `Big Walk` / 大步行 to one id is a candidate-selection
concern this class does not perform. When the curator gains entity resolution it
writes `note_entity` itself, from ids it has actually resolved.
