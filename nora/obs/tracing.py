"""OTel tracing setup (spec C.9). Strands instruments the agent loop/tools/model calls
itself; this module only configures the exporter and resource attributes.

The OTLP exporter is HTTP/protobuf, not gRPC: Langfuse's collector endpoint
(`/api/public/otel/v1/traces`) speaks HTTP, and `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-
proto-grpc` was never installed to begin with (Phase 4's mypy override covered
exactly that missing import). `otlp_http` replaces the old `otlp` config value
outright rather than joining it — a gRPC option that nothing installs and
nothing can ever reach is worse than no option, and there was never a
production config using it (the live `config.toml` has always been `file`).

    `note_index_entries` is a COUNT, which is why it belongs in a dict that

    of her on this turn without saying what any of them is. The titles are
    already in the GENERATION span's prompt for a turn that had any; this
    number is the one fact a turn with NONE cannot otherwise report, and a
    trace that cannot say «she was shown nothing» reads identically to one
    where the tier was never wired.

    It is the per-turn counterpart of `nora_note_index_entries`, and the two
    answer different questions on purpose: the gauge says what the notebook
    holds NOW, this says what THIS turn saw. They diverge exactly when a turn
    matters — a reply written against an index that has since changed.

    Stamped on every span in the turn (Strands applies these to the agent span
    and each tool/model child), so filtering Langfuse to «turns that saw an
    empty notebook» costs no new instrumentation at the call sites.
